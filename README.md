# Library

Library is a small library app project made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where users can keep track of books they've already read and wish to read.
This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject)'s JavaScript course.

## Process

The focus of this project was to work with an object constructor, with the books being created as the objects and stored in a library array, where they are then displayed on screen as cards containing all the given information. Users can add new books as well as remove books. There is also a way for the user to toggle the reading status of a book instance, which is possible through a prototype function.
